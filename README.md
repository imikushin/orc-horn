longhorn-manager
========

Manager for Longhorn.

## Requirement

1. Ubuntu v16.04
2. Docker v1.12
3. For development, you need to have `nfs-kernel-server` package install on the host for testing NFS server.

For using Docker orchestrator, make sure you have `iscsiadm`/`open-iscsi` installed on the host.

## Building

`make`

## Running

`./bin/longhorn-manager`

## Experimental Server

It can be run as a single node experimental server.

`make server` will start the server bind-mounted to host port `9500`. Then you can use web browser to take a look at it's API UI, by accessing `http://<host_ip>:9500/v1`

This experimental server will contain necessary components for Docker orchestrator to work, e.g. etcd server for k/v store, nfs server for backupstore. Each of them will be started as a container.

The backupstore URL will show up as: `nfs://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/opt/backupstore` in the console when you starting the server. You can update `backupTarget` accordingly in the `v1/settings/backupTarget`.

`make server-cleanup` will cleanup the servers.
